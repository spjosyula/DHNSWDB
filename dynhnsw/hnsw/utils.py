"""
Utility functions for HNSW graph construction and maintenance.

This module provides helper functions used during HNSW index building and search:
- Layer assignment: Determines which layers a new node should appear in
- Neighbor selection: Chooses which edges to keep when building the graph

The layer assignment uses a geometric distribution to create a hierarchical structure,
where most nodes are only in layer 0, and progressively fewer nodes appear in higher layers.
This hierarchy allows for efficient search by starting at sparse top layers and zooming in.

def assign_layer(level_multiplier: float = 1.0 / np.log(2.0)) -> int:
    """
    Randomly assign a layer for a new node using geometric distribution.

    In HNSW, nodes are assigned to different layers probabilistically. Most nodes
    only appear in layer 0 (the base layer), while fewer nodes extend to higher layers.
    This creates a hierarchical structure for efficient multi-scale search.

    The probability of a node reaching layer L is: (1/exp(level_multiplier))^L

    Args:
        level_multiplier: Controls the layer distribution (default: 1/ln(2) â‰ˆ 1.44)
                          Higher values = more layers = slower build, better search

    Returns:
        Layer number (0 = bottom layer, higher = sparser upper layers)

    Example:
        >>> # Most calls return 0, occasionally 1, rarely 2+
        >>> layers = [assign_layer() for _ in range(1000)]
        >>> layers.count(0)  # Should be ~500 (50%)
        >>> layers.count(1)  # Should be ~250 (25%)

    Select M nearest neighbors from candidates based on distances.

    This is the "simple" neighbor selection strategy - just pick the M closest nodes.
    Later, we can implement more sophisticated heuristics that consider graph connectivity
    and diversity to improve search quality.

    Select neighbors using heuristic that prioritizes diversity (FUTURE).
