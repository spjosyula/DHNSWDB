"""
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) implementation module.

This module contains the core HNSW algorithm components for building and searching
graph-based approximate nearest neighbor indexes. HNSW is a fast and accurate method
for finding similar vectors in high-dimensional spaces.

Components:
- distance: Similarity metrics (cosine, L2)
- utils: Helper functions (layer assignment, neighbor selection)
- graph: Graph data structure (coming in Step 2)
- builder: Insertion algorithm (coming in Step 3)
- searcher: Search algorithm (coming in Step 4)
